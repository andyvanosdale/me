# Proof of Concept Designer and Engineer

An entrepreneur seeks an offshore user interface and experience designer and software engineer to create proof of concept apps and web sites.

As a designer, you bring experience from designing user interfaces and experiences from a requirements specification using established or theoretical thoughts but with sound reasoning. As engineer, you then turn the designs into tangible and interactive proofs for potential customers. Writing the software to make the design come alive with code is critical. You already have the tools and processes established so that you can focus on your craft. There is no language or technology requirement. The focus is on getting the proof of concept delivered with expediency, but not rushed. It is preferred that you are well-versed in cloud technologies that can host any developed backend services and data storage (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

Each project will have a specification provided that details as much about the system as possible. There may be some gaps to fill in, and questions should be raised to seek clarity. Acceptance tests will be provided with Gherkin scenarios. Projects may or not proceed in any of their original form, concept, code, or design. You will be given preference for future work on a project if it proceeds forward to a minimum viable product. 

I'm a software engineer with over 18 years of experience having worked for big tech firms, start-ups, consulting, and retailers across mobile, web, frontend, and backend. I have found my time limited to work on these due to a full-time workload. At times, I may be able to help with writing code for the projects.

## Requirements

* Completion of 3 projects (mobile app, web sites, backends) from start to finish
* Projects should be a combination of design, mobile app (iOS or Android; both preferred), web site front end, and back end services
* Timelines for the 3 projects
* List of 3 references to verify work and projects
* Knowledgable in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud (GCP), or Microsoft Azure services
* Ability to read specifications in English and Gherkin acceptance test scenarios
